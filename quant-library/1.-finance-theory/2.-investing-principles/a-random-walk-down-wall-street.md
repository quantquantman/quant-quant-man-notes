# A Random Walk Down Wall Street

### Info

* **Author:** Burton G. Malkiel
* **Publisher:** W. W. Norton & Company
* **Publication Year:** 2023 (13th Edition)

### Summary

"A Random Walk Down Wall Street" popularizes the "random walk hypothesis," which argues that stock market prices are unpredictable, making it nearly impossible to consistently outperform the market. The book advocates for a passive investment strategy, urging investors to build a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds rather than attempting to time the market or pick individual stocks. Malkiel also explores market history, speculative bubbles, and the behavioral psychology that can lead investors astray.

### Part I — Stocks and Their Value

#### Two Competing Valuation Theories

* **Firm-Foundation Theory**
  * **Idea:** Each asset has an **intrinsic value** derived from fundamentals (expected earnings, dividends).
  * **Practice:** Buy when market price < intrinsic value; sell when price > intrinsic value; markets eventually correct.
  * **Names:** Benjamin Graham, David Dodd; notable disciple: **Warren Buffett**.
* **Castle-in-the-Air Theory**
  * **Idea:** Success comes from anticipating crowd psychology and buying ahead of demand.
  * **Also called:** **Greater fool theory**.
  * **Name:** **John Maynard Keynes** (beauty-contest analogy).

#### Famous Speculative Bubbles (Market Manias)

* **Tulip-Bulb Craze (17th-century Netherlands)**
  * Rare bulbs reached astronomical prices; crash followed.
* **South Sea Bubble (18th-century Britain)**
  * Hype around opaque ventures led to extreme overvaluation and collapse.
* **1929 Crash (“Wall Street Lays an Egg”)**
  * After the Roaring Twenties, major **blue-chip stocks** fell >95% in extreme cases.
* **Post-WWII to Late-20th-Century Episodes**
  * **Tronics boom (1960s):** Anything “electronics” IPO’d at rich multiples.
  * **Conglomerate boom:** EPS “engineering” via serial acquisitions.
  * **Nifty Fifty (1970s):** “One-decision” growth stocks bid to unreasonable **P/E multiples**.
* **Modern Bubbles**
  * **Internet Bubble (late-1990s/2000):** High valuations without profits; multi-trillion value evaporated.
  * **U.S. Housing Bubble (2000s):** Easy credit and speculation; collapse triggered global financial crisis.

### Part II — How the Pros Play the Biggest Game in Town

#### Technical Analysis vs. Fundamental Analysis

* **Technical Analysis**
  * **Basis:** Price/volume already reflect information; part of the “castle-in-the-air” tradition.
  * **Methods:** Chart patterns (e.g., **head-and-shoulders**), trendlines, **filter rules**, **Dow Theory**.
  * **Evidence:** Persistent outperformance vs. **buy-and-hold** is not supported in aggregate.
* **Fundamental Analysis**
  * **Basis:** “Firm-foundation” practice—estimate intrinsic value from fundamentals.
  * **Four Value Drivers**
    1. **Expected growth rate**
    2. **Dividend payout**
    3. **Risk level**
    4. **Market interest rates**
  * **Caveats:** Forecasting errors, valuation errors, and slow/uncertain market correction; active managers underperform the broad market on average over time.

#### Efficient-Market Hypothesis (EMH)

* **Core Idea:** Prices rapidly and fully reflect available information; consistent market beating is unlikely.
* **Random Walk:** Short-term price changes are unpredictable because news is unpredictable.
* **Forms of EMH**
  * **Weak form:** Past prices/volumes don’t predict future prices (undercuts technical analysis).
  * **Semi-strong form:** All **public** information is priced (limits fundamental edge).
  * **Strong form:** All information, even **inside** information, is priced (debatable in practice).

### Part III — The New Investment Technology

#### Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

* **Risk:** Dispersion of returns measured by **standard deviation**/**variance**.
* **Diversification:** Combining imperfectly correlated assets reduces total portfolio risk (e.g., umbrellas vs. resorts).

#### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

* **Risk Types**
  * **Systematic risk (market risk):** Cannot be diversified away.
  * **Unsystematic risk:** Firm-specific; can be diversified away.
* **Beta (β)**
  * **Definition:** Sensitivity of an asset’s returns to the market (market β = 1).
  * **Implication:** Expected returns rise with **systematic risk**; compensation is only for non-diversifiable risk.

#### Behavioral Finance

* **Key Biases**
  * **Overconfidence:** Drives **overtrading**.
  * **Biased judgments:** Recency, illusion of control.
  * **Herding:** Following the crowd despite fundamentals.
  * **Loss aversion:** Losses hurt more than equal gains; leads to selling winners too early and holding losers too long.

#### Is “Smart Beta” Really Smart?

* **Definition:** Rule-based, non-cap-weighted strategies emphasizing **factors**.
* **Common Factors:** **Value**, **Size**, **Momentum**, **Low Volatility**.
* **View:** Higher returns may reflect higher risk and reduced diversification; broad, low-cost **cap-weighted** indexing often remains superior for most investors.

### Part IV — A Practical Guide for Investors

#### A Fitness Manual for Investors

* **Save regularly:** Foundation of financial security.
* **Emergency fund & insurance:** ≥3 months’ expenses; adequate coverage.
* **Put idle cash to work:** **Money-market funds**, **CDs**.
* **Use tax-advantaged accounts:** **IRA**, **Roth IRA**, **529** plans.
* **Know your goals and risk tolerance:** Match instruments to horizon and risk.
* **Homeownership:** Often sensible for many households.
* **Understand bonds:** **Zero-coupon**, **tax-exempt**, **TIPS**.
* **Be cautious with gold/collectibles:** Illiquid, high costs.
* **Minimize costs:** Fees are one of the few controllables.
* **Diversify:** Core principle across assets and geographies.

#### Life-Cycle Investing (Asset Allocation by Age)

* **Principle:** Equity share should generally decline with age as human capital wanes.
* **Illustrative Mixes**
  * **20s:** \~70% equities, 15% bonds, 15% real estate.
  * **40s:** \~65% equities, 20% bonds, 15% real estate.
  * **50s:** \~55% equities, 27.5% bonds, 17.5% real estate.
  * **Retirement:** \~40% equities, 40% bonds, 20% real estate.
* **Life-cycle (target-date) funds:** Automate glide-path allocation.

#### Three Giant Steps Down Wall Street

* **The No-Brainer Step — Buy Index Funds**
  * **Action:** Own broad, low-cost **Total Stock Market Index Funds**.
  * **Benefits:** Low fees, tax efficiency, wide diversification; historically beats most active funds over time.
* **The Do-It-Yourself Step — If You Insist on Stock Picking**
  * **Rules of Thumb**
    1. Prefer firms with sustainable multi-year **earnings growth**.
    2. Don’t pay more than **intrinsic value**.
    3. Look for credible narratives that can spark **castle-in-the-air** interest.
    4. **Trade as little as possible** (control taxes and costs).
* **The Substitute-Player Step — Hire a Pro**
  * **Vehicle:** **Actively managed mutual funds**.
  * **Reality:** Persistent outperformance is rare; if choosing, favor **no-load**, low-fee, low-**turnover** funds.
  * **Note:** **Closed-end funds** at large discounts may occasionally offer opportunities.
