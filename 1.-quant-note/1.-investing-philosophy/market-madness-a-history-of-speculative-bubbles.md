### 17th–18th Century: The Dawn of Speculative Manias

* Tulip Mania (1636–1637, Netherlands): In 17th-century Holland, rare tulip bulbs became the focus of intense speculation. Prices were driven to astronomical heights before the market spectacularly collapsed, leaving many in financial ruin.
* Mississippi Bubble (1719–1720, France): A financial scheme in France centered on the Mississippi Company, which led to a massive surge and subsequent collapse in its stock price.
* The South Sea Bubble (1719–1720, UK): The stock of the South Sea Company, which held a monopoly on trade with South America, was furiously bid up by investors on exaggerated promises of profit. The frenzy famously included a company raising capital for "an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is." The bubble's burst had a profound impact on the British economy.

* U.S. Gilded Age Speculations (1870s–1890s): A period of rapid economic growth in the U.S. marked by widespread speculation in railroads and other industries.

### Post-WWII to 1990s: New Eras of Speculation

* The "Tronics" Boom (late 1950s–early 1960s): A period where any company with a name related to "electronics" could easily go public and achieve a high valuation, driven by excitement over new technology.
* The Conglomerate Boom (1960s): A trend of building large companies by acquiring firms in unrelated industries. This often created an illusion of stable earnings-per-share growth, attracting investors and inflating stock prices.
* The Nifty Fifty (late 1960s–early 1970s): Institutional investors piled into a select group of premier growth stocks like IBM and Xerox, believing they were so solid they could be bought and held forever. This pushed their price-earnings (P/E) multiples to unsustainable heights.
* Silver Thursday (1980): A market panic precipitated by the Hunt brothers' attempt to corner the silver market.
* Japanese Asset Bubble (mid-1980s–1989): A massive bubble in Japan's real estate and stock markets that led to a prolonged period of economic stagnation known as the "Lost Decade."
* Black Monday (1987): A severe and sudden global stock market crash.
* Beanie Babies (mid-1990s): A speculative craze over collectible stuffed toys.
* The Dot-com Bubble (1995–2000): The rise of the internet fueled a massive bubble in technology stocks. Companies with little or no profit achieved enormous valuations. The subsequent crash vaporized over $8 trillion in market value.

### The 2020s: A New Decade of Mania

* SPAC Boom (2020–2021): A surge in the use of Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) to take private companies public, often with less scrutiny than traditional IPOs.

As of October 2025, it is heavily debated whether this represents a fundamental re-rating of the sector or a classic speculative bubble.
